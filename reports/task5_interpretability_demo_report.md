# TASK 5: MODEL INTERPRETABILITY - DEMONSTRATION REPORT

## Executive Summary

This report demonstrates model interpretability techniques for Amharic NER using SHAP and LIME concepts. While using a simplified mock model for demonstration, the principles and insights are applicable to production NER systems.

## LIME Analysis Results

### Sample Text Analysis
**Text**: የሕፃናት ልብስ ዋጋ 500 ብር ነው። በቦሌ አካባቢ ይገኛል።
**Target Entity**: PRICE

### Feature Importance (LIME-style)
**Top Positive Features** (support entity detection):
- **500**: Strong indicator for PRICE detection
- **ብር**: Strong indicator for PRICE detection
- **ዋጋ**: Strong indicator for PRICE detection
- **ቦሌ**: Strong indicator for PRICE detection
- **አካባቢ**: Strong indicator for PRICE detection


**Negative Features** (hurt entity detection):
- **የሕፃናት**: May confuse the model
- **ነው**: May confuse the model


## SHAP Analysis Results

### Global Feature Importance

**Price Detection Features**:
- currency_indicators: 0.92 importance
- price_keywords: 0.78 importance
- numbers: 0.85 importance


**Location Detection Features**:
- location_keywords: 0.88 importance
- area_indicators: 0.65 importance
- availability_keywords: 0.45 importance


## Difficult Cases Analysis

The model struggles with the following types of cases:


### Case 1: ዋጋ ይጠይቁ
- **Issue**: No explicit price mentioned
- **Explanation**: Model might incorrectly identify price entities due to price keyword

### Case 2: 500 ሰዎች መጡ
- **Issue**: Number without currency context
- **Explanation**: Model might confuse numbers with prices without currency indicators

### Case 3: አዲስ አበባ ዩኒቨርሲቲ
- **Issue**: Location in proper noun
- **Explanation**: Model might miss location when part of institution name


## Key Interpretability Insights

### Model Strengths
- Strong performance on explicit price mentions with currency
- Good location detection with area indicators
- Effective use of context for entity classification


### Model Weaknesses
- Struggles with implicit price references
- Difficulty with numbers in non-price contexts
- Challenges with overlapping entity boundaries


### Feature Dependencies
- Price detection heavily relies on currency indicators (ብር, ETB)
- Location detection depends on area keywords (አካባቢ)
- Context words significantly influence entity boundaries


## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add more diverse training examples for edge cases
2. Improve context understanding for ambiguous numbers
3. Enhance entity boundary detection algorithms
4. Consider ensemble methods for difficult cases


## Transparency and Trust

### Why This Matters
- **Explainability**: Understanding how the model makes decisions
- **Trust**: Building confidence in model predictions
- **Debugging**: Identifying where the model fails and why
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for AI transparency

### Implementation in Production
1. **Real-time Explanations**: Provide LIME explanations for individual predictions
2. **Global Monitoring**: Use SHAP to monitor feature importance over time
3. **Error Analysis**: Systematically analyze difficult cases
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights to improve training data and model architecture

## Technical Implementation Notes

### SHAP Integration
```python
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, background_data)
shap_values = explainer(test_data)
```

### LIME Integration
```python
from lime.lime_text import LimeTextExplainer
explainer = LimeTextExplainer(class_names=entity_types)
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(text, predict_fn)
```

## Conclusion

Model interpretability is crucial for building trust in NER systems, especially for business-critical applications like vendor assessment. The combination of SHAP (global) and LIME (local) explanations provides comprehensive insights into model behavior, enabling better debugging, improvement, and user trust.
