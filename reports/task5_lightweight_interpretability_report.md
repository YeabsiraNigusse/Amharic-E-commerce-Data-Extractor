## Individual Prediction Explanations


### Example 1: የሕፃናት ልብስ ዋጋ 500 ብር ነው። በቦሌ አካባቢ ይገኛል።

**Predictions**: [('የሕፃናት', 'O'), ('ልብስ', 'O'), ('ዋጋ', 'B-PRICE'), ('500', 'B-PRICE'), ('ብር', 'I-PRICE'), ('ነው።', 'O'), ('በቦሌ', 'B-CONTACT_INFO'), ('አካባቢ', 'O'), ('ይገኛል።', 'O')]

**Token-level Explanations**:
- **ዋጋ** → B-PRICE: Currency word present in context; Price keyword (ዋጋ) present in context
- **500** → B-PRICE: Contains digits (strong price indicator); Currency word present in context; Price keyword (ዋጋ) present in context
- **ብር** → I-PRICE: Currency word present in context; Price keyword (ዋጋ) present in context
- **በቦሌ** → B-CONTACT_INFO: Classified based on context and learned patterns

### Example 2: ሴቶች ጫማ 800 ብር። መርካቶ አካባቢ።

**Predictions**: [('ሴቶች', 'O'), ('ጫማ', 'O'), ('800', 'B-PRICE'), ('ብር።', 'I-PRICE'), ('መርካቶ', 'B-LOCATION'), ('አካባቢ።', 'O')]

**Token-level Explanations**:
- **800** → B-PRICE: Contains digits (strong price indicator); Currency word present in context
- **ብር።** → I-PRICE: Currency word present in context
- **መርካቶ** → B-LOCATION: Location keywords present; Area indicator (አካባቢ) present


## Difficult Cases Analysis

**Total Difficult Cases**: 23
**Accuracy Threshold**: 70%

**Common Error Patterns**:
- B-LOCATION -> O: 17 occurrences
- O -> B-CONTACT_INFO: 12 occurrences
- O -> B-LOCATION: 10 occurrences
- I-PRICE -> B-PRICE: 8 occurrences
- B-PRICE -> I-PRICE: 4 occurrences


## Model Behavior Insights

### Strengths
- **Price Detection**: Strong performance on explicit price mentions with currency
- **Pattern Recognition**: Effective use of character n-grams for Amharic text
- **Efficiency**: Fast training and prediction suitable for production

### Weaknesses
- **Context Understanding**: Limited ability to understand complex contexts
- **Ambiguous Cases**: Struggles with implicit entity references
- **Location Coverage**: Limited to predefined location patterns

## Interpretability Features

### 1. Feature Importance
- **TF-IDF Features**: Character-level patterns important for Amharic
- **Manual Features**: Digit presence, currency indicators, location keywords
- **Coefficient Analysis**: Direct interpretation of logistic regression weights

### 2. Prediction Explanations
- **Rule-based Reasoning**: Clear explanations for classification decisions
- **Context Analysis**: Identification of supporting evidence in text
- **Confidence Indicators**: Feature-based confidence assessment

### 3. Error Analysis
- **Systematic Identification**: Automatic detection of difficult cases
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common error types and frequencies
- **Improvement Guidance**: Specific recommendations for model enhancement

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Expand training data with more diverse examples
2. Improve handling of implicit entity references
3. Add more location and contact patterns
4. Consider ensemble methods for difficult cases


## Comparison with Transformer Models

### Advantages of Lightweight Approach
- **Memory Efficiency**: Requires minimal computational resources
- **Interpretability**: Direct access to feature weights and decision logic
- **Speed**: Fast training and inference
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of model behavior

### Trade-offs
- **Accuracy**: Lower performance compared to transformer models
- **Context**: Limited understanding of long-range dependencies
- **Generalization**: Less robust to unseen patterns

## Conclusion

The lightweight NER model provides a good balance between performance and interpretability for resource-constrained environments. While it achieves lower accuracy than transformer models, it offers clear insights into decision-making processes and can be effectively used for understanding entity detection patterns in Amharic text.

The interpretability analysis reveals that the model relies heavily on explicit indicators (currency symbols, location names) and character-level patterns, making it suitable for applications where transparency is more important than maximum accuracy.
